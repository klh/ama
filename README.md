### Ask me anything!

<a href="../../issues/new">Ask a question</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc">Read questions</a>


I get questions by email, occasionally. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code.
Cooking. Traveling. Sports. Teaching. Pok√©mon. Whatever.

### Guidelines

 - Ensure your question has not already been answered.
 - Use a succinct title and description.
 - Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker ([GitHub](https://github.com/klh/) repository).
 - Be nice, civil and polite ([as always](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)).
